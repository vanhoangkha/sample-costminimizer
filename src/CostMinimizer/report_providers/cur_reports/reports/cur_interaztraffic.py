class CurInteraztraffic(CurBase):
    """
    A class for generating reports on Inter-AZ traffic based on AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data.
    This class extends CurBase and provides methods for querying and processing data related to
    Inter-AZ traffic costs and usage.

    The report focuses on identifying resources that generate significant Inter-AZ traffic,
    which can help in optimizing network usage and potentially reducing associated costs.

    This class is part of a larger system for analyzing AWS costs and usage. It specifically
    targets inter-Availability Zone (AZ) data transfer, which can be a significant cost factor
    in multi-AZ deployments.

    Key features:
    - Queries AWS Athena to retrieve CUR data
    - Processes and formats the data into a pandas DataFrame
    - Provides methods for report customization and data retrieval

    Note: This report does not calculate direct cost savings but provides insights for
    potential cost optimization strategies.

    Attributes:
        ESTIMATED_SAVINGS_CAPTION (str): A class-level constant representing the column name
                                         for estimated savings in the report. This is typically
                                         set by the parent CurBase class. For this report, it's
                                         used to maintain consistency with other reports, even
                                         though no direct savings are calculated.
        app (object): An application context object, typically set during initialization,
                      which provides access to configuration and utilities.
        report_result (list): A list to store the processed report data. Each item in this list
                              is typically a dictionary containing the report name, data, and type.
    """

    # Class-level attributes are typically defined here, if any exist beyond those inherited from CurBase
